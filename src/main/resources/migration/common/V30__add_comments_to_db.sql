In RaS, tagged bail is linked to a court case, so depending on which sentence was selected in NOMIS, the court case information may be innaccurate. \n   Source of Data Quality Issue: Accuracy \nNOMIS Equivalent Entity: NOMIS \nDomain: Court results including person sentences ';

When a person is guilty of violating Prison Rule 51 or Young Offender Institution Rule 55, an Independent Adjudicator (IA) may order the person to serve additional days in custody on top of the custodial period.\n   Data Quality Parameter: In the Adjudication system, there are user input fields which may be entered incorrectly by the user, such as incorrect selection of consecutive or concurrent sentence types, incorrect selection of ADAs instead of Prospective ADAs, and ADAs being recorded as comments instead of selected as ADAs directly. Thus as ADAs are directly calculated from Adjudications and the only option for the user is to accept them, if there is an issue with the Adjudication record there will also be an issue with the ADA record. This can then cause issues as the user can only amend adjudication records in the prison where the charge is heard. If the user and offender are in a different prison, then the user needs to reach out to the original prison the charge was heard and this causes operational difficulties.\n   Source of Data Quality Issue: Accuracy \nNOMIS Equivalent Entity: Adjudications \nDomain: Person sentence calculations ';
